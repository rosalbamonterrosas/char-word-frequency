# char-word-frequency

This program, developed in C++, determines the number of words and the number of occurrences of each letter in a block of text stored in a datafile called "mytext.dat". 

When outputting the number of words and letters that occur in a line, the upper- and lowercase versions of a letter are counted as the same letter. 

The output lists the letters in alphabetical order and lists only those letters that do occur in the input datafile.
